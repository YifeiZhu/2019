            <br />
            <div id="1" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                Finite groups of Lie type, such as SL<sub>n</sub>(ùîΩ<sub>q</sub>), Sp<sub>n</sub>(ùîΩ<sub>q</sub>)..., are
ubiquitous in mathematics, and calculating their cohomology has been a
central theme over the years. Without any structural reasons as to
why, it has calculationally been observed that, when calculable, their
mod ‚Ñì cohomology agree with the mod ell cohomology of <i>LBG</i>(‚ÑÇ), the
free loop space on <i>BG</i>(‚ÑÇ), the classifying space of the corresponding
complex algebraic group <i>G</i>(‚ÑÇ), as long as <i>q</i> is congruent to 1 mod ‚Ñì.
This despite that <i>LBG</i>(‚ÑÇ) and <i>BG</i>(ùîΩ<sub>q</sub>) are vastly different spaces, also
at a prime ‚Ñì, ruling out some space-level equivalence. In recent
joint work with Anssi Lahtinen, that combines ‚Ñì‚Äìcompact groups with
string topology √† la Chas&ndash;Sullivan, we give a general structural
relationship between these two cohomologies, which, suitably
formulated, even works without any congruence condition on q, as long
as it is prime to ‚Ñì. We use this to prove structured versions of
previous calculations, and establish isomorphism in new cases. The
isomorphism conjecture in general hinges on the fate of a single
cohomology class in exceptional Lie groups at small primes. My talk
will begin to tell this story, as we know it so far...

                Let <i>M</i> be a connected topological manifold of dimension at least 2 with 
                an effective action of a finite group <i>G</i>.  Associating with the orbit 
                configuration space <i>F</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>M</i>, <i>n</i>), 
                <i>n</i> ‚â• 2 of the <i>G</i>-manifold <i>M</i>, we try 
                to upbuild the theoretical framework of orbit braids in <i>M</i> &times; <i>I</i> 
                where the action of <i>G</i> on <i>I</i> is trivial, which contains the following 
                contents:  we introduce the orbit braid group 
                ùìë<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>orb</sup>(<i>M</i>, <i>G</i>), 
                and show that it is isomorphic to a group 
                with an additional endowed operation (called the extended fundamental 
                group), formed by the homotopy classes of some paths (not necessarily 
                closed paths) in <i>F</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>M</i>, <i>n</i>), 
                which is an essential extension for 
                fundamental groups. The orbit braid group ùìë<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>orb</sup>(<i>M</i>, <i>G</i>) 
                is large enough to contain the fundamental group of <i>F</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>M</i>, <i>n</i>) 
                and other various braid groups as its subgroups. Around the central position of 
                ùìë<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>orb</sup>(<i>M</i>, <i>G</i>), we obtain five short exact sequences weaved 
                in a commutative diagram. We also analyze the essential relations among 
                various braid groups associated to those configuration spaces 
                <i>F</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>M</i>, <i>n</i>), <i>F</i>(<i>M</i>, <i>n</i>), 
                and <i>F</i>(<i>M</i>/<i>G</i>, <i>n</i>). 
                We finally consider how to give the presentations of orbit braid groups in terms of orbit braids as 
                generators. We carry out our work by choosing 
                <i>M</i> = ‚ÑÇ ‚âà ‚Ñù<sup>2</sup>  with typical actions of 
                ‚Ñ§<sub><i>p</i></sub> and (‚Ñ§<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>. We obtain the presentations of 
                the corresponding orbit braid groups, from which we see that the 
                generalized braid group <i>Br</i>(<i>D</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>) (introduced by Brieskorn) actually 
                agrees with the orbit braid group 
                ùìë<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>orb</sup>(‚ÑÇ\{0}, ‚Ñ§<sub>2</sub>)  and 
                <i>Br</i>(<i>D</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>) is a subgroup of the orbit braid group 
                ùìë<sub><i>n</i></sub><sup>orb</sup>(‚ÑÇ, ‚Ñ§<sub>2</sub>). This talk is based upon 
                a joint work with Hao Li and Fengling Li.

            <div id="4" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                We define the double of a simplicial complex and study its connectivity 
                properties. The definition is motivated by homological stability: one 
                can study homological stability for a sequence of groups 
                <i>G</i><sub>1</sub> ‚Üí <i>G</i><sub>2</sub> ‚Üí <i>G</i><sub>3</sub> ‚Üí ... using an associated simplicial 
                complex; the double of this complex is related to stabilizing 
                in steps of two <i>G</i><sub>2</sub> ‚Üí <i>G</i><sub>4</sub> ‚Üí <i>G</i><sub>6</sub> ‚Üí ....  
                Because of this, homological stability suggests that if a simplicial 
                complex is highly connected, so is its double, a result that we prove 
                under appropriate assumptions. (This is joint work with Kathryn Lesh

                <i>G</i>-spectra can be reduced to the following problem:  given <i>n</i>, and 
                <i>H</i> < <i>G</i>, with <i>G</i> a finite <i>p</i>-group, 
                how big can <i>r</i> be such that there 
                exists a finite <i>G</i>-complex with <i>G</i>-fixed points of chromatic type <i>n</i>, 
                and <i>H</i>-fixed points of chromatic type <i>n</i>+<i>r</i>?  Barthel et al. solve 
                this problem when <i>G</i> is abelian by showing that a "blue shift" upper 
                bound that they establish is realized with a family of examples 
            previously analyzed by Arone and Lesh, and basically due to Mitchell. <br />
            
            In my talk I will discuss recent and ongoing joint work with my student 
            Chris Lloyd, on a way to construct examples that is both much more 
            elementary and much more flexible than previous constructions.  The idea 
            is to feed lens spaces associated to representations of <i>G</i> into Jeff 
            Smith's "machine" for constructing type <i>n</i> complexes:  the examples are 
            thus well chosen stable wedge summands of smash products of lens spaces 
            associated to well chosen <i>G</i>-representations.  The method yields 
            alternatives to the Arone&ndash;Lesh examples and new examples too, and is 
            well suited for investigation by computer.   For example, we are able to 
            resolve the first unknown case, when <i>G</i> is the dihedral group of order 
            8 and <i>H</i> is a noncentral subgroup of order 2: the maximal shift is 
            2, not 1, as was previously thought.

                Suppose <i>G</i> is a finite group, and <i>f</i> is a map from a CW complex <i>F</i> 
                to the fixed point of a <i>G</i>-CW complex <i>Y</i>.  Is it possible to extend 
                <i>F</i> to a finite <i>G</i>-CW complex <i>X</i> satisfying <i>X</i><sup><i>G</i></sup> = <i>F</i>, and extend <i>f</i>
                to a <i>G</i>-map <i>g</i>: <i>X</i> ‚Üí <i>Y</i>, such that <i>g</i> is a homotopy equivalence 
                after forgetting the <i>G</i>-action? <br />
                
                In case <i>Y</i> is a single point, the problem becomes whether a given 
                finite CW complex <i>F</i> is the fixed point of a <i>G</i>-action on a finite 
                contractible CW complex.  In 1942, P.A. Smith showed that the fixed 
                point of a <i>p</i>-group action on a finite ‚Ñ§<sub><i>p</i></sub>-acyclic complex 
                is still ‚Ñ§<sub><i>p</i></sub>-acyclic.  In 1971, Lowell Jones proved a 
                converse for semi-free cyclic group action on finite contractible <i>X</i>.  
                In 1975, Robert Oliver proved that, for general action on finite 
                contractible <i>X</i>, if the order of <i>G</i> is not prime power, then the only 
                obstruction is the Euler characteristic of <i>F</i>.  <br />
                
                We extend the classical results of Lowell Jones and Robert Oliver to 
                the general setting.  For semi-free action, we encounter a finiteness 
                type obstruction.  For general action by group of not prime power 
                order, the obstruction is the Euler characteristics over components of 
                <i>Y</i><sup><i>G</i></sup>. We calculate such obstructions for various examples.  <br />

               Representation spheres and universes are prominent in classical 
                equivariant stable homotopy theory, but more recent approaches to 
                the subject emphasize algebraic structure over the representation 
                theory. In this talk, I will discuss how these two perspectives 
                are reflected on the level of <i>N</i><sub>‚àû</sub> operads. <br />
                
                Roughly speaking, a <i>N</i><sub>‚àû</sub> operad is a structure that 
                parametrizes homotopy commutative monoids equipped with additional 
                equivariant transfer maps. Since Blumberg and Hill's groundbreaking 
                work, it has been known that the homotopy theory of <i>N</i><sub>‚àû</sub> 
                operads is essentially algebraic. However, this viewpoint ignores the 
                peculiarities of the natural geometric examples, namely the Steiner and 
                linear isometries operads over incomplete universes. I will describe a 
                few cases where one can characterize such operads in purely algebraic 
                terms, and I will explain why for most groups, there are <i>N</i><sub>‚àû</sub>
                operads that are not equivalent to any Steiner or linear isometries operad.<br />

                A fundamental problem in 4-dimensional topology is the 
                following geography question: which simply connected topological 
                4-manifolds admit a smooth structure?  
                After the celebrated work of Kirby&ndash;Siebenmann, Freedman, and 
                Donaldson, the last uncharted territory of this geography question is 
                the "11/8-Conjecture."  This conjecture, proposed by Matsumoto, 
                states that for any smooth spin 4-manifold, the ratio of its

                 The symplectic K-theory groups 
                <i>K</i>Sp<sub>*</sub>(‚Ñ§) may be defined similarly to usual algebraic K-theory <i>K</i><sub>*</sub>(‚Ñ§), 
                replacing the group GL<sub><i>n</i></sub>(‚Ñ§) by the symplectic group Sp<sub>2<i>g</i></sub>(‚Ñ§).  
                Much is known about the relationship between <i>K</i>Sp<sub>*</sub>(‚Ñ§) and <i>K</i><sub>*</sub>(‚Ñ§), 
                due to work of Karoubi and others.  I will explain that large cyclic subgroups of 
                Sp<sub>2<i>g</i></sub>(‚Ñ§) may be used to detect an important part of <i>K</i>Sp<sub>*</sub>(‚Ñ§), 
                and furthermore to understand an action of field automorphisms of the complex numbers on the <i>p</i>-adic completion.  
                This is joint work with T. Feng and A. Venkatesh.

                K-theory is a central object of study that relates algebraic 
                topology, number theory and geometric topology, among other fields.  
                There are many ways of constructing K-theory. Classical results tell us 
                that these are all "the same" in an additive sense.  In this talk, I 
                will discuss joint work with Osorno in which we prove a multiplicative 
                comparison of two classic K-theory constructions, those of Segal and 
                Waldhausen.  In particular, this produces comparisons of commutative 
                ring spectra and spectrally enriched categories.

                This is joint work with Vitaly Lorman and James D. Quigley. 
                The ‚Ñ§/p-Tate cohomology spectrum of the <i>n</i>'th 
                Johnson&ndash;Wilson theory splits as a wedge of (<i>n</i>-1)'th 
                Johnson&ndash;Wilson theories (after completion). 
                We construct a <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>-equivariant lifting of this splitting 
                for Real Johnson&ndash;Wilson theories. 
                The <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>-fixed points of this splitting is a higher height 
                analogue to Davis and Mahowald's splitting of the Tate 
                cohomology spectrum of <i>ko</i> as a wedge of <i>H</i>‚Ñ§.

            <div id="16" class="toshow" style="display:none">
                Red shift is the philosophy that the chromatic height <i>n</i> part of a 
                ring spectrum controls the chromatic height (<i>n</i>+1) part of its 
                algebraic K-theory. A recent result of Bhatt, Clausen and Mathew shows 
                that this philosophy is precisely true if the ring spectrum is a 
                discrete ring. I will report on joint work with Markus Land and Georg 
                Tamme, where we find a new proof of this result and provide 
                generalizations to <i>ko</i>- and <i>tmf</i>-algebras.
